## Loops

Loops are used to execute either one statement or a block of statements multiple times.

## ForEach Loop

The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.

## map method

The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

## filter method

The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

## reduce method

The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

## hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope before code execution.

## API and Restful API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. It uses the HTTP methods to perform the operations.

HttP methods:

- GET: To retrieve data from the server.
- POST: To send data to the server.
- PUT: To update data.
- DELETE: To delete data.

## Fetch API

Fetch API is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers.

## Promise

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
