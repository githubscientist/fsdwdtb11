### Setting up React App using Vite

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new React app.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

2. You will be prompted to type project name. Type project-name and press enter.

3. Next, select the framework you want to use. Select react and press enter.

4. Next, select the variant you want to use. Select javascript and press enter.

5. Next, Open the folder in VSCode Editor.

6. Open the terminal inside VS Code and run the following command to start the development server.

```bash
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

### Props Drilling

When you have a deeply nested component structure, passing props from the top-level component to the bottom-level component can be cumbersome. This is known as prop drilling.

### Disadvantages of Prop Drilling

1. Prop drilling makes the code harder to maintain.
2. The data is unncessarily passed through the intermediate components, which can be a performance issue.

### Passing Data Using Props

1. Parent to Child Data Passing

```jsx
// Parent Component
import React from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

const Parent = () => {
  const name = 'John Doe';
  return <Child name={name} />;
};

export default Parent;

// Child Component
import React from 'react';

const Child = (props) => {
  return <h1>{props.name}</h1>;
};

export default Child;
```

2. Child to Parent Data Passing (without using useState)

```jsx
// Parent Component
import React from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

const Parent = () => {
  const handleData = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  return <Child handleData={handleData} />;
};

export default Parent;

// Child Component
import React from 'react';

const Child = (props) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    props.handleData('Hello from Child');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
};

export default Child;
```

### Day-24 Exercises

1. Create a small application where:

- The Parent component (App) handles the temperature (in Celsius).
- A Child component(DisplayTemperature) receives the temperature as prop from the parent and displays it with a label "Current Temperature: 25Â°C".

2. Create a small application where:

- Parent Component (App):

  - receive a static message or name from the child component via props.
  - display the received message.

- Child Component (ChildComponent):
  - define a static string(e.g., "Alex" or "Hello from the child!")
  - pass this static data back to the parent through a prop (callback).
